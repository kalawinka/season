The “Social nEtwork And ScientOmetric aNalysis” (SEASON) project explores scientific collaboration between India and Germany. Scientometric and social network indicators are used to appraise the quantitative and qualitative published scientific literature. This project aims to investigate the influence of different patterns of collaboration on the citation impact among Indo - German researchers. The project is funded through the UGC DAAD project based personnel exchange programme (PPP 2021-22); DAAD project number: 57608852.  

Dr. Philipp Mayr from the GESIS Department Knowledge Technologies for the Social Sciences (KTS) is the German project leader. Dr. R. Jeyshankar, Associate Professor in the Department of Library and Information Science, Pondicherry University, leads the project from the Indian side.  

The first of two planned exchange visits took place from November 24, 2022 to December 16, 2022: Dr. Philipp Mayr and Nina Smirnova from GESIS visited Pondicherry University.  
During the stay the objectives of the first study were established and a first dataset was compiled. The goal of the 1st study is to analyse the 32 years patterns and citation trends of international collaborative research between India and German and to identify the stronger and weaker collaborative areas involved in Indo-German scientific collaboration. Approx. 38,000 publications containing German and Indian affiliations were collected for the analysis. Publishing years were restricted from 1999 to 2022. Additionally a corpus containing acknowledgements from these publications was developed. Analysis of acknowledgement texts may give an insight into aspects of the scientific community, such as reward systems, collaboration patterns, and hidden research trends.
